# 🚀 MLOps Dashboard Structure - Updated

## 📂 **Dashboard Location in MLOps Architecture**

According to our **Ultimate MLOps Project Structure**, the enhanced dashboard is now properly located at:

```
project/
├── observability/                  # 📈 Monitoring & Observability
│   ├── dashboards/                # Grafana, custom dashboards
│   │   ├── enhanced_dashboard.py  # 🎯 Our Enhanced Dashboard (NEW LOCATION)
│   │   ├── launch_enhanced_dashboard.sh
│   │   └── launch_enhanced_dashboard.bat
│   ├── logging/
│   ├── metrics/
│   ├── tracing/
│   └── alerting/
```

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### ✅ **ORGANIZED**
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: `observability/dashboards/enhanced_dashboard.py`
- **Launch Scripts**: Moved to same folder for organization
- **Main Launcher**: New root-level scripts for easy access

### 🗑️ **REMOVED**
- **Old Dashboard**: `educational_resources/scripts/04_streamlit_dashboard.py` (deleted)
- **Old Processes**: All previous streamlit instances stopped

### 🚀 **NEW LAUNCH METHODS**

#### **Quick Launch (Root Level)**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./launch_dashboard.sh

# Windows

```

#### **Direct Launch (From MLOps Location)**
